### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a human, more commonly called "Molten". I am a teenager and i write âœ¨badâœ¨ code. Support server and stuff: https://discord.gg/vgxjJW2rRH I get distracted on everything, and keep some social life. That is the reason i don't have the best github stats, here are some Metrics to show that i still have friends:
